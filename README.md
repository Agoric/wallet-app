# Agoric Wallet Site

## Development

See [wallet/README.md](wallet/README.md)

## Production

### Manual testing

`yarn && yarn build && yarn preview`

### Deploying

https://wallet.agoric.app/ serves the latest build of the production branch.

To deploy, push to that branch. e.g. if you've qualified main:

`git push origin main:production`

# E2E Testing

E2E tests have been written in order to test the dapp as well as to perform automated testing on emerynet/devnet when upgrading the chain

There are two ways to run the tests:

## On Local Machine

### 1. Start the development server

To run tests on your local machine, first you need to start the development server:

```bash
yarn build && yarn preview
```

### 2. Ensure Keys are in Local Keyring

You need to ensure that the key `user1` is present in your local keyring. To find the mnemonic for this key, open the file `test/e2e/test.utils.js`. In this file, you will find an object named `mnemonics`, which contains the mnemonics for different keys, including `user1` and `user2`.

If you are going to run tests with `CYPRESS_AGORIC_NET=local`, use the mnemonic for `user1`. Otherwise, use the mnemonic for `user2`.

Regardless of which mnemonic you choose, make sure to name the key `user1` when adding it with the `agd` command.

**Note:** The test case for adding keys using `agd` from the CLI might fail. This is expected behavior and is fine when testing on your local machine.

### 3. Adjust agops Path in Code

These tests use the `agops` command for placing bids. Ensure that `agops` is properly configured on your computer.

To adjust the file path for `agops` in code to match your local machineâ€™s directory structure. Open the file located at `test/e2e/support.js` in your code editor. Go to `line number 10` and locate the path configuration for `agops`. Modify this path to match the actual location of agops on your computer.

### 4. Running the a3p chain(optional)

If you plan to run tests with `CYPRESS_AGORIC_NET=local`, you must start the `a3p` chain beforehand. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 ghcr.io/agoric/agoric-3-proposals:latest
```

Alternatively, you can create an `a3p` chain from a specific branch in your `agoric-sdk` repository. To do this, navigate to the `a3p-integration` directory in your `agoric-sdk` repository. Install all necessary dependencies and build the project with:

```bash
yarn && yarn build
```

Once the build is complete, locate the Docker image you just created by running:

```bash
docker images
```

Find the hash of your new image and start the container using the hash:

```bash
docker run -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 {hash}
```

### 5. Run the tests

Next, run the tests using the following command:

```bash
CYPRESS_AGORIC_NET=<network> yarn test:e2e
```

where `network` can be: `local`,`emerynet`,`devnet`, `xnet` or `ollinet`.

**Note:** The tests use chrome browser by default so they require it to be installed.

## On Github

To run the tests on github, you can use the workflow trigger to run the tests.

Go to: Actions > E2E Tests (On the left sidebar) > Run Workflow

It provides a handful of parameters that can be used to modify the run according to your needs

- `branch` you can change the branch on which the tests run
- `network` you can change the network on which to run the tests
